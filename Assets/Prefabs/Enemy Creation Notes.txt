enemies need the enemy tag and the ignoreraycast layer to work properly

the tag is for the lock on system, this lets the player check every enemy for lock on purposes
the ignore raycast layer is because a raycast is made to check if the player can actually see the enemy. if they cant, then the enemy is ignored.
